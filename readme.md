## Concept
Appropriate polypharmacy is a major challenge for modern medicine.
Often patients are treated with too many drugs, which results in an ineffective or even harmful therapy.
Our application aims to facilitate contact between two parties, making the therapy more effective and economically effective.


The app provides an all-in-one tool for a patient to access their medical history.  
It stores records of one's illnesses, examinations *(with results)* and medicines taken.  
Additionally, it aids during treatment by reminding one to take their medicine and
collects feedback on how they feel so as to asses how effective the treatment is.

Additionally, using this system, doctors can access the data on all of their patients.
This relieves the patient and doctor from the duty of delivering medical documentation and copying it for future reference respectively.
A doctor can add to the patient's record any medicine prescribed, illnesses diagnosed or examinations conducted. 

## Technologies
The project consists of a web application made with React, and a server created using Node and ExpressJS.  
The reminder system functions via push notifications.
